# App logic

This directory contains Farmhand Shuffle app logic. App logic is distinct from game logic. It is concerned with the user experience and presentation of the game. It is minimally concerned with the mechanics of the core Farmhand Shuffle card game.

In terms of a [three-tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture), app logic encompasses the Presentation layer.
