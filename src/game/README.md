# Game logic

This directory contains Farmhand Shuffle game logic. Game logic is distinct from app logic. It is concerned with the mechanics of the core Farmhand Shuffle card game. It is not concerned with user experience or presentation.

In terms of a [three-tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture), game logic encompasses both the Business Logic and Data layers.
